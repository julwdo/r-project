\section*{Abstract}
This project leverages a dataset of 700 bank customers, incorporating variables such as age, education level, employment history, and financial metrics, to develop predictive models for customer default. Employing R for data exploration, visualization, and machine learning, the project aims to identify statistically significant features. Subsequently, accurate models are trained, and their performance is assessed. The project culminates in the creation of an interactive Shiny app, enabling users to input customer data and receive predictions on loan default likelihood.
